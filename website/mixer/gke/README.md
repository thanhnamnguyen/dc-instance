# First Time GCP and GKE Setup

Instructions of the initial setup of the GCP project and GKE clusters for deploying Data Commons Mixer service.

## Steps

- [Create a Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects). If working on an existing project, you should have owner/editor role to perform the tasks.

- Install [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install). Make sure the version is 4

  ```bash
  yq --version
  ```

- Make a copy of the `config.yaml.tpl` as `config.yaml`. We will populate the fields in `config.yaml` as we progress through the walkthrough.

  ```bash
  cp config.yaml.tpl config.yaml
  ```

- Add the GCP project id used for deployment in `config.yaml`, **project** field.

- Add the GCP project that hosts the Bigquery table in `config.yaml`, **store** field.

- Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

- Authenticate `gcloud` operations locally.

  ```bash
  gcloud auth login
  gcloud components update
  ```

- Create a global static IP in GCP.

  - Run:

    ```bash
    ./create_ip.sh
    ```

  - Record the IP address and update it in `config.yaml`, **ip** field.

- Add the domain in `config.yaml`, **domain** field. If you want to use the domain from Cloud Endpoints, it would be `mixer.endpoints.<PROJECT_ID>.cloud.goog`.

- Enable the GCP services.

  ```bash
  ./enable_services.sh
  ```

- Create a service account.

  ```bash
  ./create_robot_account.sh
  ```

- Setup service account.

  - Run

    ```bash
    ./setup_robot_account.sh
    ```

  - If you see authentication errors, need to contact DataCommons team to complete some of the role binding operations as the service account need access to the Cloud Bigtable and Big Query.

- Deploy Extensive Service Proxy.

  - Add API title in `config.yaml`, **api_title** field. If omit, the API title would be the same as the domain.
  - Run:

    ```bash
    ./setup_esp.sh
    ```

- Create Google Managed SSL Certificate.

  ```bash
  ./setup_ssl.sh
  ```

- Create the cluster.

  - Add the cluster region in `config.yaml`, **region** field.
  - Add the number of nodes in `config.yaml`, **nodes** field.
  - Run:

    ```bash
    ./create_cluster.sh
    ```

- Make sure the managed SSL certificate is "ACTIVE" by checking ["Load balancing" in GCP](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/net-services/loadbalancing/advanced/sslCertificates/list?sslCertificateTablesize=50). This can take minutes up to hours.

- [Optional] DNS Setup for custom domain
  - This is only needed if you use custom domain (instead of the default domain provided by Cloud Endpoints).
  - [configure the DNS in the domain registrar](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates/google-managed-certs#update-dns).
