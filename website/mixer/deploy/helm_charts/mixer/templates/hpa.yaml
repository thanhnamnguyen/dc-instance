# HPAs are autoscalers that scale the number of 
# deployments (and therefore pods).
#
# Mixer APIs are deployed by service groups (sets of APIs). 
# For each service group, the autoscalers will scale up
# deployments according to memory usage.
#
# For more on HPAs, see:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale
